# Welcome to C++ Adventures!

Buckle up, coding enthusiasts! We're about to embark on our very first C++ journey, and like any epic quest, we'll start with the basics. We'll dive into the fundamental syntax of C++, explore the mysterious realms of namespaces, navigate the intricacies of classes and member functions, and uncover a treasure trove of other shiny new concepts. Think of it as our coding bootcamp – lots of foundational stuff to get you battle-ready!

## ex00. Megaphone

For our maiden task, we have a straightforward yet mighty mission: create a program that echoes your input back to you in ALL CAPS. It’s like your very own digital megaphone! If you don’t provide any input, fear not – our program will still have something to shout, but it’ll default to a preset message, also in glorious capital letters.

**Example:**
```cpp
./megaphone HELLO
// Output: HELLO

./megaphone
// Output: DEFAULT MESSAGE
