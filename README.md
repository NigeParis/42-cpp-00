# Welcome to C++ Adventures!

Buckle up, coding enthusiasts! We're about to embark on our very first C++ journey, and like any epic quest, we'll start with the basics. We'll dive into the fundamental syntax of C++, explore the mysterious realms of namespaces, navigate the intricacies of classes and member functions, and uncover a treasure trove of other shiny new concepts. Think of it as our coding bootcamp – lots of foundational stuff to get you battle-ready!

## ex00. Megaphone

For our maiden task, we have a straightforward yet mighty mission: create a program that echoes your input back to you in ALL CAPS. It’s like your very own digital megaphone! If you don’t provide any input, fear not – our program will still have something to shout, but it’ll default to a preset message, also in glorious capital letters.

**Example:**
```cpp
./megaphone hello world
// Output: HELLOWORLD

./megaphone
// Output: A DEFAULT MESSAGE
```



## ex01. PhoneBook

Ready for more fun? This second exercise turns up the excitement! We're creating a super cool phonebook with an interactive terminal UI. Picture yourself adding contacts, searching for friends, and exiting the program whenever you're done – all through your trusty terminal.

### What You'll Do:
- **ADD Contacts**: Populate your phonebook with up to 8 contacts.
- **SEARCH Contacts**: Find your friends with ease.
- **EXIT**: Clear out your contact list and gracefully end the program.

But here’s the twist: Once your phonebook reaches its limit of 8 contacts, adding a new one will replace the oldest entry. So, the 9th contact will boot out the 1st, the 10th will kick out the 2nd, and so on. It's like musical chairs for your contacts!

**Example**:
